**Population Genomics:** The study of variation in a large group of individuals


## SNPs

- DNA varies roughly 1 in 1000 bases
- These changes are know as **SNPs**
- Different versions of a gene are called alleles
- We all have 2 alleles for each gene: this set of alleles is known as **GENOTYPE**

## SNPs Influence Traits

- Depending on the gene in which it resides a SNP may increase or decrease the chance of a trait (phenotype) occuring

- Some traits are influenced by many genes which means lots of SNPs may be linked to them
- Height has over 22000 related SNPs!! 


## But what about mutation???

- Both Are Changes but SNps are common and occur in 99.9% of the populationâ€‹

## We use SNPs to link genes to traits
-SNPS that are present in a population with a particular trait but not in a population without the trait are said to be "associated" with that trait

- This research is known as GWAS

- Genome Wide Association Study

## Finding SNPs can help us:
- Understand why people differ

- Predict whether someone will have a trait
